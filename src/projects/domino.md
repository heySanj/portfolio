# Drop that Domino!

Drop that Domino! is a simple game that I made for mobile devices. It started off as a small prototype, which I had liked enough, that I polished it up and released it for the 3 major mobile platforms. 

I see this game mostly as a learning experience for myself; something I did in my free time to see what its like to release a mobile game on a major platform. You can get the game for free by clicking on the links below.
