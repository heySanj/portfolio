# Neopolitan Panic!

I worked on Neopolitan Panic! as a designer and programmer in a team of 4. The game was created in a span of 72 hours for the [Ludum Dare 39 Game Jam](https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/39). The theme for the game jam was *‘Running out of Power’*. 

Players must drive an ice cream truck and deliver as much ice cream as possible before it all melts.
