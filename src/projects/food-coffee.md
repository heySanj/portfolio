# Food & Coffee Graphics

GUPSA and the SRC have numerous food and coffee events ongoing throughout the year. Each one needs a poster or marketing material that clearly and legibly display the dates and times when students can participate in the event. Some food promotions also require a voucher for students to make use of.
