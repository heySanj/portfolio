# Club Logos & Identities
Clubs at Griffith manage a large number of student clubs, each with their own values, cultures and identities. Their brands need to reflect and communicate that, across all their social media and print marketing. A well designed brand identity increases student engagement, improving the campus life and culture for Griffith University Students.
