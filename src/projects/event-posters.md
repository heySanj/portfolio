# Student Event Posters and Marketing

The SRC and GUPSA have events running year round to make student life at Uni more engaging and exciting. It was important that the graphical materials promoting these events portray that same liveliness and energy, while also capturing the theme of the event itself.

For example, the materials for outdoor events use more tranquil and calming, natural imagery to better depict the type of event these posters are advertising. Whereas materials for events held at the beach made use of the postcard aesthetic as well as tropical floral ornaments to help sell the image of a beach getaway.
