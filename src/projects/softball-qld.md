# Softball Queensland

I worked with Softball Queensland to develop their new Super Series tournament by helping create the branding and identities of the 4 new teams in the tournament. Each team had to have a unique look, feel and colour palette: to help engage with supporters and encourage a competitive spirit. 

Softball Queensland also requested I design their Masters Competition Logo as well as create marketing and print materials for their gameday events.
