# powerCore

A solo project, made in 48 hours for the [Game Makers Toolkit Game Jam](https://itch.io/jam/gmtk-jam). The theme for the game jam was *‘dual-purpose design’*.

Out of 770 entries, powerCore was considered by the judges as one of the Top 20 games, and was showcased in a [video on the GMTK Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDmjt-UfybM).
