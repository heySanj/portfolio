# Pride and Prejudice Report

*‘Pride and Prejudice: Sexual and Gender Diversity at Griffith University’* is an advocacy report by the SRC and GUPSA. After it was written, I was requested to format the report and ready it for print. Making the report as colourful as the numerous pride flags  was important to me; so each chapter has its own colour theme, book-ended by textured imagery.

It was very important that all text, titles and graphical data was legible and also fit the theme of their chapter and the report as a whole.
