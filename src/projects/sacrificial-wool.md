# Sacrificial Wool

I worked on Sacrificial Wool as a designer and programmer in a team of 3. The game was created in a span of 72 hours for the [Ludum Dare 43 Game Jam](https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/43). The theme for the game jam was *‘Sacrifices must be made’*. 

Players have to sacrifice the graphical fidelity of the game to bypass obstacles and guide their sheep to the altar.
